## Usage

Each heading within the Prewrok Study Guide provides bullet points that contain information about the headings.

This Webpage also shows how the use of each of the headings can create a webpage by providing examples within the webpage itself. Such as, the CSS borders, font, and shadowboxing. If you open the DevTools console, this webpage allows you to interact by it randomly selecting a topic to study.
